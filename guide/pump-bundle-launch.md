## What is the purpose of Bundle Launch?

The purpose of Bundle Launch is to enable sniping at the lowest possible price by executing the 'first' purchase simultaneously with token creation. Using the atomicity of Jito bundle technology ensures that no other sniper bots can intervene in the process.

Distributing purchases across multiple wallets provides the following advantages:

**Holder Distribution Effects**

* Holder concentration appears dispersed on analysis tools like DEXTools and DexScreener
* Lower single-wallet concentration reduces perceived dumping risk
* Creates natural holder distribution that enhances investor confidence

**Market Perception Improvement**

* Increased initial trading volume and holder count creates perception of an active token
* Higher likelihood of attracting genuine investor interest rather than just bots
* Establishes healthier chart formation during migration from Pump.fun to Raydium

**Risk Management**

* Different exit timing strategies possible for each wallet
* Protection of overall position even if some wallets are exposed
* Optimal gas fee efficiency through appropriate amount allocation per wallet

The core concept is securing optimal entry points through technical advantage (bundling) combined with strategic distribution.
