## How to Use **Reclaim ATA**?&#x20;

1. Open the **Reclaim ATA** page.
2. Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top-right corner to connect.
3. Click the **Refresh Button** to the right of the wallet address to load the token lists.
4. **Select the tokens** for which you want to close the ATA accounts.
5. Click the **Recover SOL button** and approve the transaction in your wallet app.

**NOTE**&#x20;

**Tokens that have been burned cannot be restored. Please double-check carefully before using this page**.
{% endhint %}

## What is the purpose of the Reclaim ATA page?

To hold tokens in any Solana wallet, an **ATA (Associated Token Account)** address for that token is required. Creating this ATA incurs a rent fee of 0.00203928 SOL. Even when the token balance reaches zero, the ATA account is not automatically deleted.

Alpheccaâ€™s Recover SOL feature allows you to close unused token ATA accounts and reclaim the **0.00203928 SOL** rent fee.

## What happens to tokens with a non-zero token balance?

Tokens with a non-zero balance will be completely **burned** before the ATA account is closed. Please carefully verify that the tokens are no longer needed before clicking the Recover SOL button.
