## How to Use Mint Token?&#x20;

1. Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top-right corner to connect.
2. Select the **token mint address** from your wallet's token list.
3. Enter the **amount of tokens** to mint.
   * The amount will be formatted with the token's decimals automatically.
4. Click the **Mint Token** button and approve the transaction in your wallet app.
5. When the transaction is completed, the **transaction signature** will be displayed at the **top right corner**.

## Why can't I mint certain tokens?

Only tokens where you hold the mint authority can be minted. The green checkmark indicates you have mint authority for that token. If you see a red X, it means either the mint authority has been revoked or is held by another wallet. You can only mint tokens you created or where mint authority was transferred to you.

## What happens after minting tokens?

The newly minted tokens are added to the total supply and deposited directly into your wallet. The transaction is permanent and cannot be reversed. Make sure to mint the correct amount as excessive minting can affect your token's value and credibility in the market.
