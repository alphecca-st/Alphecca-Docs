## How to Use Batch **Reclaim ATA**?&#x20;

1. Open the **Batch Reclaim ATA** page.
2. Import reclaim wallet **private keys**.\
   \- You can upload a `.csv`, `.txt`, or `.json` file with a single column of private keys.\
   \- Or simply paste a list of private keys directly into the input field.
3. Select **TOTAL ACCOUNTS** or **IDLE ACCOUNTS**.\
   \- **TOTAL ACCOUNTS:** Burn all tokens in the accounts and then close them.\
   \- **IDLE ACCOUNTS:** Close only the accounts with a zero balance.
4. Select wallets for reclaim.
5. (Optional) Enter Reclaim SOL to Specified Address.\
   \- This collects rent fees into a single wallet.
6. (Optional) Enter Pay Gas Fee.\
   \- This is the wallet that will pay the network gas fees.
7. **Click the "Recover Rent" button** to proceed with the transactions.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**NOTE** \
**Tokens that have been burned cannot be restored. Please double-check carefully before using this page**.
{% endhint %}

## What is the purpose of the Batch **Reclaim ATA** page?

To hold tokens in any Solana wallet, an **ATA (Associated Token Account)** address for that token is required. Creating this ATA incurs a rent fee of **0.00203928 SOL**. Even when the token balance reaches zero, the ATA account is not automatically deleted.

Alpheccaâ€™s **Batch Recover SOL** feature allows you to close unused token ATA accounts across multiple wallets at once with a single click, enabling you to efficiently reclaim the **0.00203928 SOL** rent fees from all selected accounts.

## What happens to tokens with a non-zero token balance?

Tokens with a non-zero balance will be completely **burned** before the ATA account is closed. Please carefully verify that the tokens are no longer needed before clicking the Recover SOL button.

## Can I reclaim rent fees even if the wallet's SOL balance is zero?

Yes, you can. Enable the **Pay Gas Fee** option and enter the private key of the wallet that will pay the Network Gas Fees.
