2. Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top-right corner to connect.

## What is the purpose of the Reclaim Pump PDA page?

As of August 2025, due to changes in Pump.Fun policy, when a wallet purchases Pump.Fun (Pump AMM) tokens, a one-time PDA rent fee of **0.0018444 SOL** is charged. This applies separately to both the Pump.Fun program and the Pump.Swap program. This rent fee cannot be refunded directly through Pump.Fun — each wallet owner must close the account themselves to reclaim it. Alphecca’s Reclaim Pump PDA page helps you easily check the Pump PDAs in your wallet and reclaim the rent fee without any coding.
