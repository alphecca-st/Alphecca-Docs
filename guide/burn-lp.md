## What is the purpose of Burning LP tokens?

Burning LP tokens means permanently locking your share of the liquidity pool. By burning these tokens, the liquidity provider gives up the ability to withdraw the liquidity, which signals to market participants that the liquidity is securely locked. This builds trust and confidence in the tokenâ€™s stability and security.
