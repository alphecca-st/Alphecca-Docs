## How Much Does Create Token Cost?

In addition to the Service Fees, approximately **0.019 SOL** in extra costs will be incurred.\
These cover token **ATA creation fees**, **minting fees**, **metadata fees**, and other related expenses.

## Can I trade the token immediately after creation?

No. After creating the token, you need to create a liquidity pool to enable trading. Please use Alphecca’s **Create Liquidity Pool** page to set this up.
