### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is additional token minting?

Additional token minting increases the total supply of an existing token. New tokens are created and sent to the specified wallet address.

#### Who can mint additional tokens?

Only the token owner can mint. The minting function must also be enabled when the token was created. Tokens with renounced ownership or disabled minting cannot be additionally minted.

#### Is there a limit on mint amount?

No. There is no maximum minting limit. You can mint as much as you want.

#### Can I mint directly to another wallet?

Yes. If you specify a recipient wallet address, the minted tokens will be sent directly to that address. This can be used for airdrops, team allocation, partnership token distribution, and more.
